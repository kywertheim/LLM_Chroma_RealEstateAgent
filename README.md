# LLM_Chroma_App

Context: I completed this guided programming exercise as a part of the Udacity course titled Building Generative AI Solutions.

In the Jupyter notebook, a large language model generates 10 real estate listings, which are stored in a Chroma vector database. There is a functionality where the database is semantically searched based on a buyer's preferences. This retriever returns the most relevant listing, which is incorporated into a prompt for the large language model. The retrieved listing is augmented by the model to generate a personalised description of the listing. The preferences, retriever, database, prompt template, and large language model are connected logically in a LLM chain.
